#Proxy Deep Dive Notes

#Original Intro
Everybody knows the pattern proxy, but how can you use it effectively?
What kind of proxy patterns are available, and how can you
build patterns more effectively with it? Why is reflection needed for this?
Importantly, we need only the core JDK in most cases.

This tutorial starts from the basics and continues on to
DynamicProxies, DynamicObjectAdapter and DynamicStaticProxies at runtime,
ProxyComposite, and more.

How can we combine this with invokedynamic or
maybe with another language such as Kotlin?

The session, based on the German book Dynamic Proxies,
by Heinz Kabutz and the sessionâ€™s presenter, takes a deep dive into this pattern group.
